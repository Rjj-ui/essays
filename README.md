.ve-header "George Bellows' *Club Night*" 

George Bellows arrived in New York in 1904 and quickly established a reputation within the city's art scene. Bellows painted the life of the lower classes in New York, often showing grittier sides of the city. His work *Club Night* amplifies this portrayal of the rougher sides of New York excellently. His violent scenes of boxing clubs portray a dark masculinity that resonated with many men in the art world and the lower classes.

Between 1907 and 1909, Bellows turned his focus to the underground world of boxing for the subject matter of his paintings.  Boxing was in a unclear state of legality at the time that Bellows painted *Club Night* , with the sport being permitted within clubs but not publically. Paired with the annonymous apperance of the crowd members, the dark background emphasizes the violent, grimmy nature of these club fights. The dramatic lighting covers the boxers, who are risen to the foreground atop the boxing ring, showcasing the blood and violence to the viewer. Bellows painted the boxers in an active stance, as if amidst a real fight, and us, the viewer, are there in the crowd to witness the spectacle.

In his drawings of boxing matches, he shows important moments within a boxing match such as a knockout, the introductions or the raising of the champions glove. However, with *Club Night*, Bellows painted the action as it was happening, forgoing any evident narrative elements. This is clear with the blurring of the left glove of the boxer on the left. The blurring of this glove provides the illusion of motion, the same way motion is captured through photography.

The blood on the boxer’s face is a direct call towards the violence of the sport. Used to greater affect in his other boxing paintings such as *Both Members of this Club* (1909), Bellows uses a heavy and contrasting red to show the boxer’s bloody nose. He shows attention to the figure of the injured facial part, as it is the producer of the blood, but little else on the boxer’s face, reflecting the lack of care for the individual boxer as opposed to the care for their performance in their boxing match.
