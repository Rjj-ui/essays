George Bellows arrived in New York in 1904 and quickly established a reputation within the city's art scene. Bellows painted the life of the lower classes in New York, often showing grittier sides of the city. His work *Club Night* amplifies this portrayal of the rougher sides of New York excellently. His violent scenes of boxing clubs portray a dark masculinity that resonated with many men in the art world and the lower classes.
